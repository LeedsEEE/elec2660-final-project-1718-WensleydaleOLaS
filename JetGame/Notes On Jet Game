--IMPORTANT--
    SOME EMULATORS DON'T LIKE MANY NODES ON SCREEN AT A TIME (eg iPhone 7 plus) SO THERE ARE POPPING ISSUES WITH MAINLY OCEAN GENERATION
    THIS IS RELATED TO LAG AND SHOULD NOT BE A PROBLEM ON AN ACTUAL IPHONE

The overall structure, basic functions and game logic of the program are based on Micheal Leech's how to make a 2d game series on Youtube, https://youtu.be/CWZgt8a7a-k, then adapted and manipluated to suit my needs as I have not worked with sprite kit before

App is only designed for iPhones, an iPad's aspect ratio does not work 

I decided to add a parallax effect to the terrian as it enhances the users feeling of speed
I also decided to add an extra screen to make it clear to the user that they had lost before they returned to the main menu
